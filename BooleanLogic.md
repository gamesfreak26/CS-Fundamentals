# Boolean Algebra

- Branch of mathematics that involves boolean values and operations on boolean values.
- Used to break down complex problems.
- Boolean Values may be expressed as TRUE or FALSE, or 1 and 0, respectively.

# NOT relation and operators

Unary boolean relation (it's unary as it is evaluated on one expression instead of two)

Gives the opposite of the value given

- NOT true = false
- NOT false = true

### Symbols that denote NOT

- ¬
- ˜
- !

# AND relation and operators

Both values must be true for AND to evaluate to true
