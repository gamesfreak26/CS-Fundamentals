# Boolean Algebra

- Branch of mathematics that involves boolean values and operations on boolean values.
- Used to break down complex problems.
- Boolean Values may be expressed as TRUE or FALSE, or 1 and 0, respectively.

### Legend

T | F
--- | ---
1 | 0

# NOT relation and operators

Unary boolean relation (it's unary as it is evaluated on one expression instead of two)

Gives the opposite of the value given

- NOT true = false
- NOT false = true

### Symbols that denote NOT

- ¬
- ˜
- !

# AND relation and operators

Both values must be true for AND to evaluate to true

### AND TABLE

Note: In the videos, the table is upside down.

A | B | A ∧ B
--- | --- | ---
F | F | F
F | T | F
T | F | F
T | T | T

### Symbols that denote AND

- ∧
- ·
- &

# OR relation and operators

The only time an OR is false is when both values are false

### OR TABLE

Note: In the videos, the table is upside down.

A | B | A ∨ B
--- | --- | ---
F | F | F
F | T | T
T | F | T
T | T | T

### Symbols that denote OR

- ∨
- \+
- ∥

# XOR relation and operators

Exclusive OR.  Both values can't be ( TRUE and TRUE ) or ( FALSE and FALSE ) at the same time.

Another way of writing this is: A ⊕ B = ( A ∨ B ) ∧ !( A ∧ B )

### XOR TABLE

Note: In the videos, the table is upside down.

A | B | A ⊕ B
--- | --- | ---
F | F | F
F | T | T
T | F | T
T | T | F

### Symbols that denote XOR

- ⊕
- ⊻

# Implication 

If p is TRUE, then q is TRUE.  It is **only false** when p is true and q is false.

p | q | p → q
--- | --- | ---
F | F | T
F | T | T
T | F | F
T | T | T

### Symbols that denote IMPLICATION
- ⇒
