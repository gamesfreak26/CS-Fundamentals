# Sets

## What is a set?

A set is a collection of unique items.  

```A = { 1, 3, 5 }``` is a set

```B = { 1, 3, 3, 7 }``` is not a set

## What is a domain?

A domain is the larger set that the set is from.  

So, if the domain is the string  ```"Tharanga"```, the set is ```{ "t", "h", "a", "r", "n", "g" }```

### Common Domains

Integers 
```ℤ = { ..., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ... }``` ( -∞ to +∞ )

Natural
```N = { 1, 2, 3, ... }``` ( All numbers from 1 to ∞ )

## Definitions

- Domain - The larger collection that the set is from.  
- Element - An item in the set
- Subset - One set is contained within another set.
- Proper subset - one set is contained within another set and does not contain all elements of its superset (they are not equal)
- Superset - one set contains another set 
- Proper Superset - one set contains another set and contains more than that subset (they are not equal)
