# Sets

## What is a set?

A set is a collection of unique items.  

```A = { 1, 3, 5 }``` is a set

```B = { 1, 3, 3, 7 }``` is not a set

## What is a domain?

A domain is the larger set that the set is from.  

So, if the domain is the string  ```"Tharanga"```, the set is ```{ "t", "h", "a", "r", "n", "g" }```

### Common Domains

Integers 
```ℤ = { ..., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ... }``` ( -∞ to +∞ )

Natural
```N = { 1, 2, 3, ... }``` ( All numbers from 1 to ∞ )
